# JoJo Discord Bot
A egg for our own Discord Bot which can be found here: https://github.com/lazybytez/jojo-discord-bot

### Installation
Just import the .json in the **Nests** section of Pterodactyl.

### Configuration
The only configuration you need is the **Discord Bot Token**. 

**Discord Bot Token**
The Token needs to be added as an env variable. This means you just need to copy the token into the only empty config field. 

### Important

This egg is not offically supported by Pterodactyl.  
The reason why whe created this is to stress-test our discord bot as a stage instance.
